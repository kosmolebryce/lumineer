(2022) explain, \"A **bimolecular elimination (E2)** step is one in which a proton and a leaving group (L) are eliminated from a substrate, resulting in the formation of a new double or triple bond. Like S<sub>N</sub>2 steps, E2 steps are called *bimolecular* because they involve reactant species.\" The authors note, furthermore, that \"an E2 step typically takes place when a strong base reacts with a substrate in which a leaving group (L) and a hydrogen atom are on adjacent carbon atoms.\" That is: \"In an E2 step, the substrate generally has the form H\u2014C\u2014C\u2014L or H\u2014C=C\u2014L, in which the leaving group (L) and the beta (\u00df) hydrogen are eliminated simultaneously.\"\n\n\"For this reason,\" the authors proceed \"an E2 reaction is a type of *B elimination*,\" which is a reaction in which substituenst on adjacent atoms are eliminated from a molecule, resulting in a new bond between those atoms.\"\n\nFinally, the authors conclude that \"The bsae in an E2 step is the electron-rich species, but the \u00df hydrogen atom that the base attacks is not particularly electron-porr; instead, the electro-poor atom is the carbon atom bonded to the leaving group (the \u03b1 carbon). Thus, the flow of electrons from the *electron-rich* site to the *electron-poor* site is depicted with two curved arrows. One curved arrow is drawn from the negatively charged atom in the base to the \u00df hydrogen in the substrate. The second curved arrow is then drawn from the C\u2014H bond to the bonding region between the \u03b1 and \u00df carbon atoms, and the third curved arrow is necessary to depict the departure of L to avoid exceceding the octet on the \u03b1 on the \u03b1 carbon. Overall, the electron-poor \u03b1 carbon atom gains a share of electrons from the C\u2014H bond.\""

The step is said to be *bimolecular* because it contains two separate reacting species in an elementary step. In other words, the step's [*molecularity*](file://../terminology) is 2. It is called *nucleophilic* simply because the reaction involves a nucleophile as a reactant.\n\n\"... an S<sub>N</sub>2 step is an *elementary step*, meaning that the reactants are converted into products in a *single event*.
