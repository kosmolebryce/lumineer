----

### Overview

**Innate immunity** is an organism's inbuilt strategy for protecting itself against infection. It essentially comprises the immune system's first line of defense and includes features like skin, nasal hair, and mucous. It is not pathogen-specific like *adaptive immunity* but, rather, aims to preempt all sorts of opportunistic infections.'''
